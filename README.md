Extracting real life data from UCI datasets

1 Diabetic Retinopathy

2 Default of credit card clients

3 Breast Cancer Wisconsin

4 Statlog (German credit data) (recommend german.doc for instructions and german-numeric for data.)

5 Adult

6 Yeast

7 Thoracic Surgery Data

8 Seismic-Bumps

Training the above data with models from scikit-learn's Linear regression, Support vector regression, Decision tree regression, Random forest regression
kk-nearest neighbours regression, AdaBoost regression, Gaussian process regression, Neural network regression.


Finally, building a neural network model using CIFAR-10 dataset and achieve an accuracy of 80+%
